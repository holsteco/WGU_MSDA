6,facebook,6 weeks ago,"I ordered Pokémon happy meals in the app, and when we got them, they were nerf happy meals. One had a Mario toy and the other had no toy. How do I get a refund?"
7,facebook,5 weeks ago,I don't even know why you have the app we spend all the money ordering food on there get all these points and can only use the points for one thing a day. If we spend 30 dollars for meals and I have 30000 points I should be able to get what I want until my points are gone smh and the food has gone down hill the slopyness and not caring anymore.

17,instagram,20 weeks ago,"dear grimace and mcdonalds, why must i purchase a whole meal in order to receive a grimace shake from your establishments? sometimes i am not so hungry that i would eat a whole big mac and fry/ 10 pc chicken mcnugget and fry, but I still might crave the bombastic and powerful flavor of a grimace’s birthday shake. why would you engage in such non consumer friendly practices and marketing tactics????"

19,instagram,21 weeks ago,Grim you’re absolutely perfect and look like a purple sign of hope and greatness
20,instagram,25 weeks ago,"Funny story from today. My wife and I got this meal plus an extra big Mac. The lady gave 1 packet of ketchup and when I asked for a few more she said they were out. I asked if they had any other sauces. She said sweet and sour. I said I'd take it. She then charged me for it. This is typical McDonald's, but I'll still eat there even though the love is not mutual."
21,instagram,25 weeks ago,I’d say yeah that’s fine.
22,instagram,25 weeks ago,How about serving warm food???..The new buns...the onions grilled...OK...but not even MELTED cheese???..Call me when you DO everything right!!????????????
23,linkedin,,"I recently had an unfortunate experience at McDonald's Nice Av. Jean Medecin 47 France that left me disappointed and frustrated. Despite placing my order within the 30-minute timeframe, I was unexpectedly asked to leave the premises. The lack of understanding and customer service was disheartening. Moreover, the environment was not only unwelcoming but also notably unclean, adding to the overall dissatisfaction. I believe such incidents, combined with a lack of cleanliness, significantly impact the reputation of the establishment negatively. I hope McDonald's can address these issues to ensure a more customer-friendly and hygienic environment in the future."
24,linkedin,4 weeks ago,"Yesterday around 18.00, I bought a Double Big Mc for my son from your place in Yalova (Turkey) center. My son is autistic and doesn't eat anything other than meatballs and cheese. I said nothing should be added except cheese. They said okay. I warned them once more before the package arrived, and they called inside again. I bought the package and brought it home and there was something resembling grated onion on the meatball and my son did not eat it. I became very angry. This isn't the first time this has happened to me. On average, they make a mistake every 3-4 times in your same store. Moreover, there was no intensity. I'm too afraid to buy anything from you now. I will express your insensitivity on every platform."
25,linkedin,4 weeks ago,Yes.. so cool
26,linkedin,4 weeks ago,"They were so much tastier back then too. Plus, we used the sausage patties and chopped them up reducing in store waste."
27,linkedin,4 weeks ago,"Right, they’re just grey textural globs."
28,linkedin,4 weeks ago,"The Quijano' s have been a great group here in Houston. When the burrito first came out, they were awesome. Then out of convenience, the corporation changed them. Not the same and not as tasty. There is a organization out in west Texas that still makes them the way they use to. The Wilson organization (yes, related) got it. The more convenient doesnt always mean more tastey. McDs needs to to back to the original recipe the way Mr. Quijano intended it to be. "
